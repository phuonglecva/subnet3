    "content": "The Neo upgrade and Miko hardfork will go live in 14 hours! Let’s dig in on what it means for the @Ronin_Network and the community. \n\nThis update brings two REPs to the Ronin Network blockchain. REP means Ronin Evolution Proposal, a document that is meant to introduce and implement improvements to the chain. It’s the same system as to EIP, Ethereum Improvement Proposal. The two REPs are REP -0007 and REP-0008.\n\nREP-0007: Implement EIP-2718 aka Typed Transaction Envelope\n\nTLDR on EIP-2718:\n EIP-2718 simplifies the way to introduce and differentiate new types of transactions to the blockchain.\n With Ronin adapting it, Ronin enables developers to introduce new transaction types that are backward compatible with existing ones.\n Why? Efficiency, flexibility, future-proofing Ronin!\n Allows for: New transaction types that saves gas, account abstraction, better tooling, etc.\n\nREP-0008: Sponsored Transactions\n\nThis upgrade also introduces Sponsored Transactions! It allows gaming studios on Ronin to sponsor transactions for players. Some chains tout that they’re better because they’re are gasless. While Ronin already is one of the lowest gas fee chains, we can finally say zero gas fees for players are incoming!\n\nThe Ronin Network already has the best UX that will onboard billions. These upgrades just make it better. Ronin is evolving!\n\n#RoninCreator\n\nRead more about these upgrades\n\n5 25\n74"

This is not about an election of ideas and having a difference of opinion and of how the country should work. This is literally who will get the soul of America.

They don’t. They sooner stand with communist countries always have.\n\n— This is about the destruction of America and what the Democrats will do in all of their operatives. It is point to Trump and say everything that they’re doing is what he will do. No, he was the one that had in place to do rapid DNA testing on children at the border to make sure that the person they were with was a family member. That’s a common sense thing to do. \n\nJoe Biden.
